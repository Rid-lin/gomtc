# Minimalist Netflow v5 to influxdb UDP collector written in Go 

Forked by https://github.com/strzinek/gonflux
Broker listens on specified UDP port (2055 by default), accepting Netflow traffic, and collecting records with selected metadata formatted in line protocol to UDP listener of [influxdb](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb).

Project includes dockerfile for building runtime application as [docker](https://www.docker.com) container and also [Gitlab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/product/continuous-integration) definition file both for pushing build to docker registry and also for deploying to production docker server.

To enable UDP listener for influxdb, either modify `influxd.conf` file and add:

```
[[udp]]
enabled = true
bind-address = ":8089"
database = "db_for_netflow"
```

or set following environment variables:

```
INFLUXDB_UDP_ENABLED
INFLUXDB_UDP_BIND_ADDRESS
INFLUXDB_UDP_DATABASE
```

Netflow data in influxdb can then be analyzed for example with help of [Grafana](https://grafana.com).

**BEWARE!!!**

The cardinality of general Netflow data is quite high, so to use influxdb effectively for it, I suggest using several retention policies and downsampling the measurements.

PLAN FIRST! ;-)

## Usage

```
gonflux -method udp -out influxdb.local:8089
```

Supported command line parameters:
```
  -buffer int
        Size of RxQueue, i.e. value for SO_RCVBUF in bytes (default 212992)
  -in string
        Address and port to listen for NetFlow packets (default "0.0.0.0:2055")
  -method string
        Output method: stdout, udp (default "stdout")
  -out string
        Address and port of influxdb to send decoded data
```

Or with docker container: 

```
docker run --name=gonflux -t --restart=always -p 2055:2055/udp -e METHOD='udp' -e OUT='influxdb.local:8089' -d strzinek/gonflux
```
